        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Tiny Temples is dedicated to creating a product that is an outward manifestation of one's faith in the Lord.
            We make 3D printed temples out of durable materials that last. These temples make great gifts for marriages,
            anniversaries, missionaries, gifts, or just as a simple reminder to walk the covenant path.</p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Our intended audience are members of the Church of Jesus Christ and those who would like to share in the
            faith. People of all ages enjoy the product we have to offer. College kids appear to buy these temples for
            their own personal reminders or as gifts for parents as do middle aged adults. Most of our older customers
            appear to purchase these temples as gifts for their children.</p>
        <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
        <p>To add dynamic JS elements to the website, we will add a carousel that allows the user to see various
            different temples that we can print for sale. Map will be used to allow the user to search for a desired
            temple. Lazy loading will likely be used to improve loading. If there is time, a shopping cart will likely
            be added. This will allow the user to add any desired temple(s) We will also use CSS media queries to
            account for changing screen sizes.</p>
